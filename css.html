    <h1 class="heading">What are Fruits</h1>
    <p>
        Fruits are mature ovaries of flowering plants that contain 
        seeds and develop from fertilized flowers. They are typically 
        sweet or sour in taste and are consumed for their flavor, 
        nutritional value, and often their culinary versatility. 
        Fruits play a significant role in human diets, providing 
        essential vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. They 
        come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and flavors,
        ranging from citrus fruits like oranges and lemons to berries
        like strawberries and blueberries, and tropical fruits like
        mangoes and pineapples.
